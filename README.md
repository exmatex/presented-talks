### DoE/ASCR Exascale Research Conference ###

The following talks were presented as part of the ExMatEx proxy app Deep Dive session. The
conference was held in Arlington, Virginia, October 1-3, 2012.

* [Overview of ExMatEx Proxy Applications](https://github.com/downloads/exmatex/presented-talks/ProxyAppDeepDiveIntro.pdf) [PDF], 
David Richards,  Lawerence Livermore National Laboratory, LLNL-PRES-585773.



* [CoDesign Molecular Dynamics (CoMD) Proxy App](https://github.com/downloads/exmatex/presented-talks/CoMD_DeepDive.pdf) [PDF], 
Jamal Mohd-Yusof,  Los Alamos National Laboratory, LA-UR-12-25066.

 A brief overview of the the class of physics problems targeted is presented, followed by the 
 computational considerations at both the machine and node level. Then we cover the original application
 (SPaSM) from which the mini-app was extracted, along twith the equations being solved. The implementations of
 the various versions (OpenCL, CUDA, Intel MIC) of the proy app are discussed, along with some performance
 metrics. In situ visualization is then briefly discussed. Modeling of the proxy app in Aspen is
 presented along with some preliminary results. Finally, the status of the mini-app is summarize and
 plan for future enhancements are presented.
